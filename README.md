## Description

_So here's this thing, it takes words, reverses the order of the words, and excludes anything with 3 characters or less, it's pretty bad._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Open HTML_
* _Enter some words_
* _Watch scripts.js interact with index.html_
* _Get your words back in Reverse_

## Known Bugs

_I sprayed OFF! on my computer as I wrote this, so it's bug free, except for mutant cockroaches._

## Support and contact details

_To get in contact with me wait at the Payphone by Dollar General until it rings, answer for further instructions._

## Technologies Used

_I'm using magic to make this, HTML, Bootstrap, and Javascript._
